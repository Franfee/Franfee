## Studying
#### 我有个大到不切实际的idea : SimulateCerebrum-Multimode-Partitioning 
- 名字 "仿生：人在回路参与多模态分区的神经网络架构"
- 想法来源 "三位一体大脑在进化中的作用"
- 可能基础: "Transformer, CLIP, BLIP, SDM, Toolformer, LangChain"
- 我没有足够的能力和资源完成，忙于其它事务，暂时也无法更新。如果有大佬感兴趣，请随意使用。
### I had an impossible idea: SimulateCerebrum-Multimode-Partitioning 
- Named "Simulate: Cerebrum Multimode Partitioning with Human Interaction"
- Inspired by "The Triune Brain in Evolution: Role in Paleocerebral Functions"
- Technical basis: "Transformer, CLIP, BLIP, SDM, Toolformer, LangChain"
- I don't have the ability or resources to finish it, and I'm too busy with other things to update it at the moment. If anyone is interested, feel free to use it.
